    "NetsPresso is a platform that provides tools and infrastructure for building and deploying machine learning models. One of its powerful features is the NetsPresso Compressor, which helps optimizing machine learning models by reducing their size and computational requirements. This is achieved through techniques such as pruning, which can be done using various norms like L2 and GM, or filter decomposition techniques such as Tucker decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), or Canonical Polyadic (CP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured pruning is a model compression technique that involves removing specific weights or connections from a neural network while preserving its overall structure. This technique can significantly reduce the size of the model and make it faster to run on edge devices without compromising its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook demonstrates the process of static structured pruning for deep learning models using NetsPresso. It covers the process of training a classification model, pruning, fine-tuning, and quantizing it using the STM32 model zoo. The STM32Cube.AI Developer Cloud is then used to benchmark the models.**\n"
